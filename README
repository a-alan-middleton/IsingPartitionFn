If you have all the libraries available, which might well be the case, simply
  enter 'make'. This will compile codes and place them in the bin directory.
  It will also run a short test. If the test succeeds, there will be no messages.
  If the test fails, don't worry, yet: the check is for the full precision of the
  result and it is conceivable that different versions of gmp will give very slight
  differences in the last few digits of the long decimal outputs.

Necessary libraries for ising Z include gmp, gmpxx (GNU multiprecision library)..
The disorder realization generator needs gsl (GNU scientific library).
  You can modify the Makefile in src/Z/ and src/generator/ if you need to
  clarify where those libraries sit. (For example, on one of
  the authors' computers, where gmp and gsl are installed in bizarre places,
  the additions to the makefile include:
    INC		= -I/sw/include/gsl -I/sw/include/
    LIBS	= -lgmpxx.4 -lgmp.3 -L/usr/local/lib -L/sw/lib/x86_64/ -lgsl
  )

Conventions for input format for Ising samples:
 See sample files in src/test/ for examples of input files.
 These files include system size and a list of bond weights, two
   bond weights per spin. The weights are indexed by spin coordinates
   and bond directions.

misc/ has some simple examples for timing (takes an hour or so to run), how to test
the exp() and log() functions, and how to compute domain wall energies for a number
of samples (takes less than a minute to run).
Also see extraTest.sh to see density of states for lowest energies in 32x32 FM Ising model.
